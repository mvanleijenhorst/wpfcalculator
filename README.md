WPF calculator with binding

This application is an example how you can use binding with WPF.
And it can help you why you should use binding.

Why should you use binding. I seperate the hard coupling between you UI and business logic.
UI tests are expesive and hard to maintain. If you seperate UI and business logic it is easier to test.
And you get faster feedback and can change easier.
